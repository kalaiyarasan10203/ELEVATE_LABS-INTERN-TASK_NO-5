# 🚦 Wireshark Traffic Analysis – Task 5

## 📌 Task Objective:
Capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify at least 3 different protocols, and analyze the packets.

---

## ✅ Tools Used:
- **Wireshark** (Network Protocol Analyzer)
- **Browser** and **Ping Command** for generating traffic
- **WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/login/** the website used to capture the traffic.

## 🔍 Summary of Findings:

1. **HTTP** packets were observed when accessing a website via browser. These included GET and response headers.
2. **DNS** packets were generated during domain name resolution when websites were accessed.
3. **TCP** was used as the transport layer protocol for reliable transmission of HTTP/DNS packets.
